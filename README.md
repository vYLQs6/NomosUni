Dataset Name: NomosUni

License: check sources

Num images: 2989 (512x512px) 

Purpose: 'Multipurpose'

Description:

Consider this dataset a distillation of both Nomos8k and HFA2k, plus some newly added images. The idea was to build a 'universal' dataset containing photos, paintings, anime, writings, etc. This is a deliberately 'small' dataset, as quality consistency, diversity, and balance between categories were the main goals.
